**Hand Gesture Recognition System**

This project demonstrates a basic hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The system captures video from your webcam, detects hand landmarks, and recognizes simple gestures like "Open Hand" and "Pointing Up."

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
MediaPipe (mediapipe)
NumPy (numpy)

**How It Works**


The script captures video frames from your webcam.
Each frame is processed to detect hand landmarks using MediaPipe.
Gestures are recognized based on the position of specific hand landmarks.
The recognized gesture is displayed on the video feed.
Example Gestures
Syntax Sarcasm: Recognized when the thumb and index finger are pointing up.
Join the Workshop: Recognized when the thumb is down and the index finger is pointing up.
